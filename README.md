# Chatbot
 Task1_Sync_Intern


While completing the task for this week, I developed a chatbot using a machine learning model to assist a client in managing their business. The chatbot was created with Dialogflow. 
The primary goal of the model was to identify and respond to user's welcome messages, booking appointment, ensuring a friendly and engaging start to the conversation.
To enhance the chatbot's performance, I incorporated various entities into the training data. 
These entities enable the chatbot to better understand and extract important information from user inputs, leading to more accurate and contextually relevant responses. 
By doing so, the chatbot can efficiently address the specific needs of the users and provide valuable assistance in managing the client's business.
Overall, the client was pleased with the chatbot's capabilities and how it streamlined their business management processes.
